Hi, my name is **Tobias Lohse**. I’m a generalist software engineer who enjoys designing systems that are as elegant as they are practical — whether that means clean code, intuitive apps, or nimble teams.

Over the past decade I’ve worn many hats: co-founder, founding engineer, and engineering manager/director for teams of a few dozen. Work across health-tech, climate, cinema, and developer-tooling has kept things varied — some projects demanded deep, hands-on coding and architecture, while others were all about shaping lightweight structures and processes to empower teams to move independently.

My toolbox spans the full stack: training ML models with PyTorch, crafting iOS, Android, and Web experiences with React (Native) and TypeScript, building scalable back-ends in Python and Node.js, and most recently leveraging generative AI to enable new kinds of features. Functional programming, Domain-driven design, strong static types, integration testing, observability, and CI/CD keep the complexity in check. I try to write simple code, use light frameworks or build things from scratch, and gravitate toward “boring” open-source tech that’s easy to deploy via Docker.

Originally from Berlin, I’ve lived in Chile and Kenya and now call Chicago home. When the laptop closes, you’ll find me mixing cocktails, cooking, exploring art, or chasing adventures with my two daughters.

Curious for details? Browse the resume or get in touch — I’m always happy to chat, swap ideas, or take on the occasional consulting project.
